# Ryukyu Two

# Objective of Game: 
  - Beat all 10 levels of the game to recieve the highest score! 
  - The game is a combination of poker and solitaire, where the player chooses from four piles to draw cards from then places them in one-of-five columns to form some sort of poker hand
  - To beat a level, players are required to have a certain amount of points which is done by getting the best hands possible vertically, horizontally, and/or diagonally 
  - If a player does not pass the level, they are allowed to add another credit to continue playing
    - They also get to randomly choose an omikuji (fortune slip) to receive bonus points for the next level (i.e. spin the wheel mechanism) 
    - If they put in another credit to continue, the player's progress and score is saved
